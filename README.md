This game is my entry for the Young Coders Sphere Coding Competition and intends to help show how CS can be used to help make the internet safer and more respectful for youth. My game displays internet safety suggestions when the player crashes to incorporate a fun component while teaching the user about internet safety. It also promotes internet safety because there is no multiplayer chat features in the game or connecting with strangers online. Lastly, there aren't any ads in the game that give the user a virus on their computer.
